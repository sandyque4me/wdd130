        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello! My name is Sandra Ezeh" width="200">
        <p>Hello! My name is Sandra Ezeh and I am from Abuja, Nigeria. I love truth and justice. I obtained my first degree from Imo State University, Owerri, Nigeria, where I studied Industrial Chemistry, which is a fultime four year course in Nigerian universities. I graduated in 2006 and served my country during my National Youth Service year, 2018/2019, during which I started teaching Chemistry in secondary schools till date.  My passion for emmerging technology has compelled me to go ahead and acquire knowledge in one of the tecnology courses which is not offered here in any of the Nigerian Universities. This passionate drive have connected me to one of the American schools that now offer online courses. I am currently studying Web Design and Development at Brigham Young University, Idaho, USA. This has been my life long dream over the years. Fulfilling this dream is a long awaited desire. I have yearned to be a Software Engineer and here I am. I am excited to learn about them. I look forward to creating my own website and learning more about the industry. I am excited to see what the future holds for me.</p>
